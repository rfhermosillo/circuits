\chapter{Diode Circuits}

Diodes are nonlinear circuit elements so many diode circuits are nonlinear in nature. Diodes can be used in circuits to rectify AC voltages, clamp and clip voltages, etc. Special diodes, such as Zener diodes, can be used for still other applications such as generating a voltage reference or biasing a bipolar transistor.

\section{Half-wave rectifier (Neamen p.63)}
% Add capacitor in parallel with the load resistor for a DC voltage
\section{Full-wave rectifier (Neamen p.67)}

\section{Full-wave bridge rectifier (Neamen p.68)}
%For the three above circuits a negative voltage can be generated by reversing %the direction of the diodes.
\section{Voltage doubler (Neamen p. 79)}

\section{Zener diode voltage regulator (Neamen p. 80)}
%Remember to note that v_out is usually followed with an op amp buffer.

\section{Voltage clipper (Neamen p. 88)}
%The voltage sources in the circuit on p.88 can be replaced with Zeners as in %the circuit on p. 90.
\section{Voltage clamper (Neamen p. 91)}
